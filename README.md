# toggl-keypad

Uses https://github.com/matthewdowney/TogglPy as the API wrapper to simplify things

Set up:

Copy `config.sample.cfg` to `config.cfg` and edit it:

- insert your Toggl API key
- set up list of projects with Toggl project IDs
- set up list of keys to react to (by default these are 1-4 and 0 for stopping)
